I change the previous colors to my new color pallatte which are cream, mint, and green palette via inline style attributes. The login page lives in a centered card with a green-accented headline and rounded input/button. The Chat sidebar shows each user with their avatar and “Online” label. In the main panel, there’s a header with “💬 KayChat” plus a cheeky subtitle, and a “no messages” placeholder when the chat is empty. Each message bubble uses mint colors, rounded corners, and a green send-button to keep the look consistent and inviting.
